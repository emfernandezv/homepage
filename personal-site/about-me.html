        <p id="P1-paragraph">Howdy! My name is Eduardo and I enjoy solving problems and improving processes. I started software programming in 2009 when I started customizing a local server for a popular MMOPRG game. 
            For some reason, I was able to understand part of the C# code it was scripted. In 2010 I started my professional formation in Software Engineering - turns out that in no time I got a Junior Programmer position in a <span>leading
            HR Software company</span> that noticed I was capable of fast learning new developer tools (they were using PowerBuilder and I mastered it in 1 month).<br><br>
            A couple of years later I got <span>a new offer from a leading corporation</span> and my knowledge about different businesses started to increase exponentially. This corporation had companies in retail, 
            importation, manufacture, and textile that needed my abilities to improve accuracy, and time and reduce workload.<br><br>
            Years later, my first company wanted me back, now as a consultant and later as a manager. We took the whole <span>HR software to the next level</span> moving software processes that required decent hardware on each user's PC to a 
            database processing schema that not only solved the hardware-forced requirements but also <span>improved processing time 50x faster.</span><br><br>
            I am working currently at AdvancedMD as an Interoperability Analyst Sr sharing my experience and <span>helping other developers</span> to interface with our software solutions. During this time, I have been thinking 
            that even though my career had had a big push into the labor field, my tools weren't enough to keep up, that's why I decided to continue my professional formation at BYU-I to learn newer ways to help more entities here in the US.<br><br>
            Here are a few technologies/tools I've been working with recently:<br><br>
            <span>-</span> Python &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <span>-</span> HTML &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <span>-</span> CSS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <span>-</span> API (RPC/REST) <br>
            <span>-</span> PowerScript &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <span>-</span> SQL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <span>-</span> PL/SQL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <span>-</span> JavaScript</p>
