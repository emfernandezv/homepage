        <p id="P1-paragraph">Howdy! My name is Eduardo and I enjoy solving problems and improving processes. I discovered my interest in software development in 2009 when I started customizing a local server (hosted in my desktop)
                             for a popular <a href="https://maplestory.nexon.net/landing" target="_blank"> <span>MMOPRG game</span></a>. For some reason, I was able to understand part of the C# code it was coded.<br><br> 

                             In 2010, I started my professional formation in <a href="https://upc.edu.pe/" target="_blank"> <span>Software Engineering</span></a> 
                             and in 2011 started my professional path on different positions in leading companies of different industries that had in-house software developed in <a href="https://www.appeon.com/products/powerbuilder" target="_blank"> <span>PowerBuilder</span></a> 
                             which I had mastered during my first month as a Junior Developer.<br><br>
            
                            Since then, I have been working on different projects for different industry companies such as <a href="https://www.sygnusconsulting.com" target="_blank"> <span>Human Resources</span></a>,
                            <a href="http://www.jeruth.pe/" target="_blank"> <span>Multi-industries corporations</span></a>, <a href="https://www.electroperu.com.pe/ElectroWebPublica/Index.aspx" target="_blank"> <span>Energy</span></a>, 
                            <a href="https://fadesa.com/" target="_blank"> <span>Industrial Production</span></a>, <a href="http://creatra.com.pe/" target="_blank"> <span>Manufacturing</span></a>, 
                            and <a href="http://www.hscr.pe/pages/index.aspx" target="_blank"> <span>Religious Cults</span></a>.<br><br>

                            I am currently working as an <a href="https://www.zippia.com/interface-analyst-jobs/what-does-an-interface-analyst-do/" target="_blank"> <span>Interface Delivery Analyst Sr.</span></a> at a <a href="https://www.advancedmd.com/" target="_blank"> <span>leading Health Industry Software Company</span></a> sharing my experience and helping other developers to interface their custom apps 
                            with us. During this time, I have been thinking that even though my career had had a big push into the labor field, my tools weren't enough to keep up, that's why I decided to <a href="https://www.byui.edu/" target="_blank"> <span>continue my professional formation</span></a> to learn newer 
                            technologies to help more companies around the world.<br><br>
